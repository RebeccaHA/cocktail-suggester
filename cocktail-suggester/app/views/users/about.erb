  <p class="content is-medium">Guy first worked with cocktails in 2001 at a world famous jazz club in London, with no intention of pursuing a career in drinks. However, Guy fell in love with the creative process and the skill of pairing wonderful drinks with amazing food, cutting his teeth with some of the most creative industry leaders. 10 years on, Guy is now the Creative Beverage Manager for some of the best restaurants in London including Lyle’s, Gymkhana, Kitchen Table and Sabor, as well as being a drinks columnist.</p>
